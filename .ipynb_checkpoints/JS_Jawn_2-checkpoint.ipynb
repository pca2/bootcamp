    "# Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a key concept in any object-oriented programming language. Although the implementation details can vary considerably from language to language, the essential idea behind inheritance is relatively simple: message delegation. The following quote from Sandi Metz's _Practical Object-Oriented Design_ sums it up pretty succinctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Inheritance is, at its core, a mechanism for automatic message delegation. It defines a forwarding path for not-understood messages. It creates relationships such that, if one object cannot respond to a received message, it delegates that message to another.(106)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core of what inheritance is all about. If one object doesn't know how to respond to a property or method call, we check its parent object, if the parent object doesn't know how to respond, we check the next level up, and so on and so on. As we'll see today, the actual implementation details can get pretty complex pretty quickly, but it's important to keep in mind that the core of this concept is relatively straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classical vs. Prototypal Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Class-based inheritance systems are much more common than prototypal systems, so it might be helpful to quickly distinguish the two. Let's review classical inheritance briefly and then contrast it with a prototypal system. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Class-based object-oriented languages, such as Ruby or Python, primarily use two main types of abstractions to represent the world:\n",
    "- objects: A specific instance of something. An email, a cake, a customer help request, etc.\n",
    "- classes: A generalization of a type of object. They hold shared properties and functions common to all of those objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Ruby all objects belong to a class, from which they inherit properties and methods. Classes in turn can inherit things from another class. This hierarchy of `class -> subclass -> object` creates what's known as a _inheritance chain_ or _inheritance path_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at this concept using the example of cake. Say I have an ice cream cake in the freezer, we'll refer to it as `myBirtdayCake`. This specific cake is an instance of the `IceCreamCake` class. It shares certain basic properties that all members of the `IceCreamCake` have in common. The `IceCreamCake` class is in turn actually a subclass of the larger `Cake` class, as it inherits many properties from that superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name | Type | Comments |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :---: |\n",
    "| Cake | class | The base class, and in this instance, a superclass of IceCreamCake |\n",
    "| IceCreamCake | class | a subclass of Cake. Can also be said to _extend_ the Cake class |\n",
    "| myBirthdayCake | object  | an instance of the IceCreamCake class.|\n",
    "\n",
    "On a superficial level, you might think of a class as a blueprint, or recipe, for a type of objects. In the same way that you use an actual ice cream cake recipe to create a real-world ice cream cake, you can use the `IceCreamCake` class to create an `IceCreamCake` object like `myBirthdayCake`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cake receipes are of course just a set of instructions, they're not made of flour and sugar. Similiary, the `Cake` class is not a `Cake` object, it's just a set of instructions on how to make `Cake` objects. This may seem like an odd aspect to highlight, but as we'll see in a moment, this metaphor doesn't quite work with prototypal languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prototypal Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Javascript, as a prototype-based language, lacks the concept of classes\\*, as such the only abstraction it has at its disposal is objects. The need to share common properties and methods across similiar objects still exists though, and JavaScript accomplishes this by designating certain objects as __prototypes__ of others. An object will inherit all properties of its prototype, similiar to how an object in Ruby or Python inherits the properties of the class it belongs to. Let's take a look at this in action by returning to our example of `Cake -> IceCreamCake -> myBirthdayCake`.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we've mentioned before, JavaScript lacks a lot of the abstractions present in other object-oriented languages for structuring inheritance chains and reusing code. It doesn't have classes, modules, structs or anything like that; all it has is objects and functions. Also unlike many class-based languages, objects in JavaScript don't have to be part of any class or inheritance chain. A result of this spartan approach is that JavaScript is much more flexible and agnostic about how you organize your code. Consequently there are a number of different patterns that have emerged in the JS community for how to structure your inheritance. For example, the examples you learned above illustrate part of the _Prototype Pattern_. The next approarch we're going to look at is what's known as the _Constructor Pattern_"
