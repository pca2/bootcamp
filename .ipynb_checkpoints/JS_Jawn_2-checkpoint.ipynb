    "## Classical vs. Prototypal Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Class-based inheritance systems are much more common than prototypal systems, so it might be helpful to quickly distinguish the two. Let's review classical inheritance briefly and then contrast it with a prototypal system. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Class-based object-oriented languages, such as Ruby or Python, primarily use two main types of abstractions to represent the world:\n",
    "- objects: A specific instance of something. An email, a cake, a customer help request, etc.\n",
    "- classes: A generalization of a type of object. They hold shared properties and functions common to all of those objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Ruby all objects belong to a class, from which they inherit properties and methods. Classes in turn can inherit things from another class. This hierarchy of `class -> subclass -> object` creates what's known as a _inheritance chain_ or _inheritance path_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at this concept using the example of cake. Say I have an ice cream cake in the freezer, we'll refer to it as `myBirtdayCake`. This specific cake is an instance of the `IceCreamCake` class. It shares certain basic properties that all members of the `IceCreamCake` have in common. The `IceCreamCake` class is in turn actually a subclass of the larger `Cake` class, as it inherits many properties from that superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name | Type | Comments |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :---: |\n",
    "| Cake | class | The base class, and in this instance, a superclass of IceCreamCake |\n",
    "| IceCreamCake | class | a subclass of Cake. Can also be said to _extend_ the Cake class |\n",
    "| myBirthdayCake | object  | an instance of the IceCreamCake class.|\n",
    "\n",
    "On a superficial level, you might think of a class as a blueprint, or recipe, for a type of objects. In the same way that you use an actual ice cream cake recipe to create a real-world ice cream cake, you can use the `IceCreamCake` class to create an `IceCreamCake` object like `myBirthdayCake`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cake recipes are of course just a set of instructions, they're not made of flour and sugar. Similarly, the `Cake` class is not a `Cake` object, it's just a set of instructions on how to make `Cake` objects. This may seem like an odd aspect to highlight, but as we'll see in a moment, this metaphor doesn't quite work with prototypal languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prototypal Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript, as a prototype-based language, lacks the concept of classes\\*, as such the only abstraction it has at its disposal is objects. The need to share common properties and methods across similar objects still exists though, and JavaScript accomplishes this by designating certain objects as __prototypes__ of others. An object will inherit all properties of its prototype, similar to how an object in Ruby or Python inherits the properties of the class it belongs to. Let's take a look at this in action by returning to our example of `Cake -> IceCreamCake -> myBirthdayCake`.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we've mentioned before, JavaScript lacks a lot of the abstractions present in other object-oriented languages for structuring inheritance chains and reusing code. It doesn't have classes, modules, structs or anything like that; all it has is objects and functions. Also unlike many class-based languages, objects in JavaScript don't have to be part of any class or inheritance chain. A result of this spartan approach is that JavaScript is much more flexible and agnostic about how you organize your code. Consequently there are a number of different patterns that have emerged in the JS community for how to structure your inheritance. For example, the examples you learned above illustrate part of the _Prototype Pattern_. The next approarch we're going to look at is what's known as the _Constructor Pattern_"

    "\n",
    "1. __Privacy__: In the non-IIFE example immediately above, `log_secret_number` is exposed in the global name space, meaning that any other global object could call it again, which you probably don't want. Because it is immediately invoked you ensure it's invoked once and only once. Also because the `secret_number` variable is scoped to the IIFE function, it can't be accessed by anything else.\n",
    "2. __Memory/Performance__: The `log_secret_number` function is now in memory forever, even though it's not needed again. IIFEs are immediately cleaned up after use, freeing up memory.\n",
    "3. __Namespace__: Now that you've defined a `log_secret_number` function in the global namespace, there's always the possibility of collusion with another library or developer's work. Because nothing is exposed outside of the IIFE you ensure against this.\n",
